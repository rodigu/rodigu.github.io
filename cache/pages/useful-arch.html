<h2>finding missing packages</h2>
<p>i was trying to use pandoc with arch, but was getting an error when trying to convert a markdown to pdf.</p>
<p>conversion snippet:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">pandoc<span class="w"> </span>document.md<span class="w"> </span>-o<span class="w"> </span>document.pdf
</pre></div>

<p>resulted in:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">Error producing PDF.
! LaTeX Error: File `xcolor.sty&#39; not found.

Type X to quit or &lt;RETURN&gt; to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)

Enter file name: 
! Emergency stop.
&lt;read *&gt; 

l.7 \usepackage
</pre></div>

<p>to use pandoc you first need a tex engine, like texlive:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo<span class="w"> </span>pacman<span class="w"> </span>-S<span class="w"> </span>texlive
</pre></div>

<p>i installed only the ones that seemed relevant, as all packages amount to over 1 GB (??).</p>
<p>turns out, i was missing something.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/n8vbyz/latex_packages_problem/" target="_blank">this reddit comment</a> helped me out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to figure out which one you need to install to get a certain LaTeX package, use for example <code>pacman -F bbm.sty</code>. You will need to run <code>pacman -Fy</code> once if you have never used <code>pacman -F</code> at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>very good to know.
running it:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">sudo<span class="w"> </span>pacman<span class="w"> </span>-F<span class="w"> </span>soul.sty
</pre></div>

<p>gave me:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">extra/texlive-plaingeneric 2025.2-3 (texlive)
    usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/generic/soul/soul.sty
</pre></div>

<p>which i just had to install with pacman.</p>
