<p>looking at the <a href="https://github.com/rodigu/rodigu.github.io/commits/master/">commit history</a> for the repository
containing the source for this blog, you may notice that this was originally my personal website/cv.</p>
<p>my initial intention was to setup the present blog on a separate branch,
but i forgot to switch branches before deleting everything.</p>
<p>in any case, i suppose i'll have to commit to this now so here is a test post.</p>
<h2>testing out</h2>
<p>originally, i attempted to use jekyll <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, at it is already integrated into github pages.
however, after some frustration (as had happened years ago when i tried it),
i decided to look for a different blog building tool.</p>
<p>one of my main points of contention with jekyll is that is uses ruby, which i am entirelly unfamiliar with.
therefore, i went searching for a tool that allowed me to stay within what i alredy know (namely, python),
and had built-in markdown support.</p>
<p>i also want it to be doing most of the work.
i am not too interested in messing with templates and such at the moment.
all i want is to get started on throwing stuff out there.</p>
<p>so i landed on nikola <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> for static site generation.
it even has built'in support for extended markdown seeing that the footnotes are working nicely.</p>
<p>it does have support for images in markdown, but in an annoying kind of way.</p>
<p><img alt="a photo i took while biking in chicago" src="../../images/2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.png"></p>
<p>here is what the markdown for the previous photo looks like:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">![<span class="nt">a photo i took while biking in chicago</span>](<span class="na">../../images/2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.png</span>)
</pre></div>

<p>which seems fine, except that the folder structure of this repo looks a little like this (with some omitions for readibility):</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">.

<p>i am writing from <code>./posts/1.md</code>, and i am placing my image in <code>./images/</code>.
after the build, my post is in <code>./output/posts/setting-up</code>, and the image is in <code>./output/images/</code>.
meaning, while in this markdown, i can use intellisense to access the image with:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="cp">../images/2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.png</span>
</pre></div>

<p>because the image in the build is in a different directory,
i need to add an additional <code>../</code> to the beginning of the image reference <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>anyway, this is more of a minor pet peeve, so it is fine i guess.</p>
<h2>addendum 1</h2>
<p>ok, i have another pet peev, this time with github pages.
for whatever reason, github pages only allows deployement from root or from <code>/docs</code> <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">4</a></sup>?</p>
<p>so i had to change the output folder of this repo to <code>docs</code>, with the following addition to nikola's <a href="https://github.com/rodigu/rodigu.github.io/blob/master/conf.py"><code>conf.py</code></a>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">OUTPUT_FOLDER</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;docs&#39;</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>addemdum 2</h2>
<p>one last thing for this test post.</p>
<p>nikola came with a number of filed in its demo.
i deleted them manually, and then followed the instructions from the getting started page <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">5</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">nikola<span class="w"> </span>check<span class="w"> </span>--clean-files

<p>going on a tangent here, but i had to make the previous long directory reference into
its own code block instead of an in-line reference because it was breaking the layout on mobile.
i should keep this in mind for the future.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
