<p>looking at the <a href="https://github.com/rodigu/rodigu.github.io/commits/master/">commit history</a> for the repository
containing the source for this blog, you may notice that this was originally my personal website/cv.</p>
<p>my initial intention was to setup the present blog on a separate branch,
but i forgot to switch branches before deleting everything.</p>
<p>in any case, i suppose i'll have to commit to this now so here is a test post.</p>
<p><img alt="a photo i took while biking in chicago" src="../../images/2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.png"></p>
<p>originally, i attempted to use jekyll <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, at it is already integrated into github.
however, after some frustration (as had happened years ago when i tried it),
i decided to look for a different blog building tool.</p>
<p>one of my main points of contention with jekyll is that is uses ruby, which i am entirelly unfamiliar with.
therefore, i went searching for a tool that allowed me to stay within what i alredy know (namely, python),
and had built-in markdown support.</p>
<p>i also want it to be doing most of the work.
i am not too interested in messing with templates and such at the moment.
all i want is to get started on throwing stuff out there.</p>
<p>so i landed on nikola <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> for static site generation.
it even has built'in support for extended markdown seeing that the footnotes are working nicely.</p>
