<p>last year, masp's new annex opened to the public. i had the opportunity to visit at opening week. a few weeks before that, i bought a tiny thermal camera that prints on receipt paper.</p>

<p>using the tiny camera is lots of fun. i get to print and see the image as soon as they are taken.</p>

<p>the paper is also cheap (a <em>lot</em> cheaper than instax). i could even reuse regular print paper, which is something i do actually want to try out in the future.</p>

<p>the annex is out of place and discrete at the same time.</p>

<p>the annex was actually built on top of a pre-existing building. they reused some of the foundations and original structure.</p>
