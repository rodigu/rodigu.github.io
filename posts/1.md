.. category: technical

looking at the [commit history](https://github.com/rodigu/rodigu.github.io/commits/master/) for the repository
containing the source for this blog, you may notice that this was originally my personal website/cv.

my initial intention was to setup the present blog on a separate branch,
but [i forgot to switch branches before deleting everything](https://c.tenor.com/Bi5t9IXWlEkAAAAC/tenor.gif).

in any case, i suppose i'll have to commit to this now.
so here is a test post.

## testing out

originally, i attempted to use [jekyll]((https://jekyllrb.com/)) for this blog, as it is already integrated into github pages.
however, after some frustration (as had happened years ago when i last tried it),
i decided to look for a different blog building tool.

one of my main points of contention with jekyll is that it uses ruby, which i don't have anything against, but am also entirelly unfamiliar with.
therefore, i went searching for a tool that allowed me to stay within what i alredy know (namely, python),
and that had built-in markdown support.

i also want it to be doing most of the work.
i am not too interested in messing with templates and such at the moment.
all i want is to get started on throwing stuff out there.

so i landed on [nikola](https://getnikola.com/) for static site generation.
it even has built'in support for _extended_ markdown, seeing that the footnotes are working nicely.

it does have support for images in markdown, but...

![a photo i took while biking in chicago](../../images/2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.png)

here is what the markdown for the previous photo looks like:

```md
![a photo i took while biking in chicago](../../images/2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.png)
```

which seems fine, except that the folder structure of this repo looks a little like this (with some omissions for readability):

```bash
.
├── images
│   ├── 2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.png
│   ├── frontispiece.jpg
│   └── illus_001.jpg
├── output
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── 2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.png
│   │   ├── 2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.thumbnail.png
│   ├── index.html
│   └── posts
│       ├── setting-up
│       ├── index.html
│       └── index.md
├── posts
│   └── 1.md
└── README.txt
```

i am writing from `./posts/1.md`, and i am placing my image in `./images/`.
after the build, my post is in `./output/posts/setting-up`, and the image is in `./output/images/`.
meaning that while in this markdown i can use intellisense to access the image with:

```
../images/2025-03-30_16-37_chicago-skyline-biking.png
```

however, because the image in the output build is in a different directory,
i need to add an additional `../` to the beginning of the image reference[^5].

[^5]: going on a tangent here, but i had to make the previous long directory reference into
its own code block instead of an in-line reference because it was breaking the layout on mobile.
i should keep this in mind for the future.

anyway, this is more of a minor pet peeve, so it is fine i guess.

## addendum 1

ok, i have another pet peev, this time with github pages.
for whatever reason, github pages only allows deployement from root or from `/docs`[^3]?

[^3]: at least according to the answer to [this community question](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23073)

so i had to change the output folder of this repo to `docs`, with the following addition to nikola's [`conf.py`](https://github.com/rodigu/rodigu.github.io/blob/master/conf.py):

```py
OUTPUT_FOLDER = 'docs'
```

## addemdum 2

one last thing for this test post.

nikola came with a number of filed in its demo.
i deleted them manually, and then followed the instructions from the [getting started page]((https://getnikola.com/getting-started.html#rm-demo)):

```bash
nikola check --clean-files
```
